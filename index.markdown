MODES (Model-Driven Evolution for Secured Systems) is a four-year project funded by [French National Agency for Research (ANR)](https://anr.fr/). MODES is in the ANR funding category « [Jeunes Chercheuses et Jeunes Chercheurs (JCJC)](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/programme-jeunes-chercheuses-et-jeunes-chercheurs-jcjc/) » 

The high level objective of the MODES project is to allow for systems to be updated to better fulfill their missions while maintaining their security properties. MODES will boast security of software systems by helping them securely evolve and adapt to different types of evolution events. MODES is a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach that considers the systems at a high level of abstraction as a set of
heterogeneous models. In this sense, MODES leverages on multi-model management techniques.
