In the context of the ANR JCJC MODES project (Model-Driven Evolution for
Secured Systems), we seek a PhD candidate to work on the security consistency
management for complex systems. The PhD candidate will work in the P4S
team at IMT Atlantique & Lab-STICC (CNRS), Brest, France. The position is
for 3 years from Fall 2024.

## Offer Details

**Location**: IMT Atlantique - Brest Campus, France.

**Start date**: Fall 2024

**Keywords**: security, software engineering, software evolution, model-driven, engineering, SecDevOps

**Team**: P4S/SHARP/LabSTICC (UMR 6285)

sponding motivation letter, recommendation letter(s) and a list of both already
published papers and open source contributions (if any) to any of the contacts listed above

## Summary

Security is a critical concern in current software intensive systems in which vul-
nerabilities may have a severe impact and produce damages ranging from data
privacy losses to even physical harm (e.g., cyber-physical systems). To allevi-
ate this problem, security mechanisms (e.g., access-control, cryptography, etc.)
have been integrated in many different components and artefacts so that it is
possible to implement a security policy meeting the security requirements of a
given system. Unfortunately, nowadays systems are very complex, encompass
many different (evolving) components (e.g., code, libraries, models, databases,
configurations), and interact with changing environments (e.g., they may be re-
deployed). In this scenario, security is scattered between different components
and artifacts, and consequently, the problem of security consistency arises (e.g.,
dependent components with available security mechanisms may fail to synchro-
nize leading to potential security vulnerabilities). Contributing solutions to this
problem is the high-level objective of this PhD proposal.

### Objectives

The concrete scientific and technical objectives of this proposal may be
adapted to the expertise and skills of the successful candidate as long as they
fall in the general objective of contributing to security consistency management.
We list in the following some suitable contributions:

- reverse engineering the security status of existing/deployed complex sys-
tems. This may include the means to: 1) represent and manage the se-
curity dependencies between components/artifacts; 2) express consistency
requirements.
- mechanisms to detect inconsistencies and semi-automatically repair them.
As with the concrete scientific and technical objectives, the application do-
main for the works of this project is open and adaptable to the interests and
knowledge of the successful candidate. Nevertheless, the P4S team is currently
very active in the domain of digital twins, particular complex systems that may
greatly benefit from security consistency.
