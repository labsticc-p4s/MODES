Under the interest of introducing efficiency, cost-effectiveness and safety, Information and Communication
Technologies have been integrated in many different environments, including critical ones (i.e., environments
where a system failure regarding its missions, business operations, safety and/or security would have severe
adverse impacts that range from data loss to even loss of life). This integration makes systems prone to
a wider range of security issues and consequently, Research and Industry efforts have been directed at
enhancing the security of these systems by integrating existing security mechanisms (controls), developing
new ones and advocating for secure-by-construction development processes. Unfortunately, systems are
far from being static. E.g., vulnerabilities may be discovered after the system is deployed or the system
modified on required maintenance/evolution phases. Due to the economic, reputation and trust damage
the aforementioned security vulnerabilities entail, Cybersecurity is of utmost importance for our society. A
secure software evolution method for complex systems, which does not exist as of now, would help prevent
security incidents, many of which would have incurred in economical losses for both, services and users.

MODES will boast security of software systems by helping them securely
evolve and adapt to different types of evolution events. MODES will do so by leveraging on multi-model
management techniques and contributing new languages and methodologies.
